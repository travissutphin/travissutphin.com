   - Not optimized for search intent
   - Missing long-tail keyword opportunities
   - No pillar content strategy

5. **AEO Gaps** üö®

## üìà SEO/AEO Implementation Strategy

### 1. Topic Cluster Architecture

**Pillar Page Model:**
```
[Pillar Page] AI Project Completion Guide (2000+ words)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Cluster] Why Your AI Project Is Stuck at 80%
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Cluster] Vibe Coding Do's and Don'ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Cluster] The Hidden Cost of Vibe Coding
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Cluster] AI Speed Trap: Systems Over Speed
```

**Benefits:**
- Establishes **topical authority** for "AI project completion"
- Creates **internal linking** network
- Targets **high-value keywords** with supporting long-tail content
- Signals expertise to search engines

**Immediate Action:**
Create pillar pages for top 3 categories:
1. "Complete Guide to AI Project Completion" (AI & Automation)
2. "Technical Project Management: From Planning to Delivery" (Project Management)
3. "Productivity Systems That Actually Work" (Productivity)

---

### 2. Search Intent Mapping

Categorize content by user intent:

**INFORMATIONAL** (Learn about topic)
- Tag: `Guide`, `Explained`, `What Is`
- Example: "What Is Vibe Coding? A Beginner's Guide"

**NAVIGATIONAL** (Find specific resource)
- Tag: `Framework`, `Template`, `Checklist`
- Example: "RACI Chart Template for Project Management"

**TRANSACTIONAL** (Take action / hire)
- Tag: `Consulting`, `Services`, `Solutions`
- Example: "Why Your AI Project Is Stuck (And How to Fix It)"

**COMMERCIAL** (Evaluate solutions)
- Tag: `Comparison`, `Best Practices`, `Case Study`
- Example: "Outgrowing Excel: When to Build a Web App"

**Implementation:**
Add `intent` field to frontmatter:
```yaml
intent: "informational"
search_query: "how to manage AI projects"
```

---

### 3. AEO Optimization

**For Answer Engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google SGE):**

**A. Structured Content Formatting**
```markdown
## Problem
[Clear statement of user's problem]

## Solution
[Step-by-step actionable answer]

## Why It Works
[Explanation/reasoning]

## Next Steps
[Call to action]
```

**B. FAQ Schema Markup**
Add to posts with Q&A format:
```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "Why do AI projects get stuck at 80%?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "..."
    }
  }]
}
```

**C. Answer-Intent Tags**
- `How To`
- `Why [Problem]`
- `What Is`
- `Best Practices`
- `Common Mistakes`
- `Step-by-Step Guide`

---

### 4. URL Structure Optimization

**Current:** `/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug`

**Proposed:** `/blog/[category]/[title-slug]`

**Examples:**
- `/blog/ai-automation/vibe-coding-dos-and-donts`
- `/blog/project-management/raci-chart-guide`
- `/blog/productivity/weekly-big-3-framework`

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Category appears in URL (SEO signal)
- ‚úÖ More readable/shareable URLs
- ‚úÖ Supports breadcrumb navigation
- ‚úÖ Aligns with site architecture

**Migration Strategy:**
- Keep dated URLs for existing posts (301 redirects)
