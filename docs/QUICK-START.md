## Documentation Best Practices

### When Creating New Docs
**Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario | Action | Type | Location |
|----------|--------|------|----------|
| "How do I do X?" asked 3+ times | Create guide | AUTHORITATIVE | `/processes/` |
| Design standards need documenting | Create reference | REFERENCE | `/design/` |
| Planning new feature/strategy | Create plan | PLANNING | `/content-strategy/` |
| One-time migration/fix | Create log | ARCHIVE | `/archive/` |

### Document Status Badges
Always include at the top of new docs:
```markdown
**Status:** üü¢ CURRENT
**Owner:** [YourRole]
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Next Review:** YYYY-MM-DD (quarterly for authoritative docs)
```

### Status Badge Meanings
- üü¢ **CURRENT** - Up-to-date, use this
- üü° **REVIEW** - May be outdated, verify first
- üî¥ **DEPRECATED** - Don't use (moved to `/archive/`)
- ‚≠ê **AUTHORITATIVE** - Single source of truth, follow exactly

---

## Development Workflow

### Definition of Done
Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Automated tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product Owner ([Travis]) acceptance

### Git Workflow (Simplified)
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "your message"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. Railway auto-deploys from main branch
5. Merge to main only after [Travis] approval

**Full details:** [Git Workflow](workflows/git-workflow.md)
