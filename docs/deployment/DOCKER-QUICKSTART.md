docker-compose --profile test run test

# Check container health
docker ps
docker inspect travissutphin-web | grep -A 5 Health
```

```

### Debugging
```bash
# Enter container shell
docker exec -it travissutphin-web bash

# Check Apache config
docker exec travissutphin-web apache2ctl -S

# Check PHP config
docker exec travissutphin-web php -i

# Test from inside container
docker exec travissutphin-web curl http://localhost/
```

## üöÇ Railway Deployment (Phase 3)

### Local Testing for Railway
```bash
# Test production build
docker build -t travissutphin-prod .
docker run -p 8080:80 travissutphin-prod

# Verify railway.json
cat railway.json | python -m json.tool
```

### Railway CLI Commands
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Create new project
railway init

# Deploy to Railway
railway up

# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Open deployed app
railway open
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs web

# Verify Dockerfile syntax
docker build --no-cache .

# Check port conflicts
netstat -an | grep 8080
```

### Site Not Loading
```bash
# Verify container is running
docker ps

# Check Apache is running
docker exec travissutphin-web ps aux | grep apache

# Test internal connectivity
docker exec travissutphin-web curl http://localhost/
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix ownership inside container
docker exec travissutphin-web chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

# Rebuild with correct permissions
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

---

## üìä Performance Testing

```bash
# Basic load test with Apache Bench
docker run --rm --network travissutphin-network alpine/httpie ab -n 100 -c 10 http://web/

# Check resource usage
docker stats travissutphin-web

# Monitor logs during load
docker-compose logs -f web
```
