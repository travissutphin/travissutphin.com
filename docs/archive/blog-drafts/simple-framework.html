                <p>Why do Mondays feel like putting out fires while juggling chainsaws? Because we're doing it wrong.</p>

                <p>I used to start each week reacting to whatever landed in my inbox. The result? Constant stress, missed deadlines, and that nagging feeling that I was always playing catch-up.</p>

                <h2>Here's what changed everything:</h2>

                <p>I now spend 30 minutes every Monday morning in "CEO mode" - treating my week like a business that needs strategic direction. The transformation has been incredible:</p>

                <h3>Before:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Racing to respond to every "urgent" email</li>
                    <li>Back-to-back meetings with no prep time</li>
                    <li>Important projects pushed aside for daily firefighting</li>
                    <li>Weekend work just to stay afloat</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>After:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time blocked for deep work when my energy peaks</li>
                    <li>Meetings clustered for maximum efficiency</li>
                    <li>Clear priorities that actually drive results</li>
                    <li>Evenings and weekends back with family</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The simple framework I use:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Brain dump everything on your plate (15 mins)</li>
                    <li>Identify your top 3 needle-moving priorities (5 mins)</li>
                    <li>Block time for these BEFORE your calendar fills up (10 mins)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The best part? That constant anxiety of "dropping the ball" vanishes when you know exactly where your focus needs to be.</p>
