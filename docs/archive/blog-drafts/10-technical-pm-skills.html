            <h2>1. Speaking "Engineer" Without Sounding Like a Robot</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Engineers have their own language (e.g., "Just refactor the tech debt!"). If you nod along pretending you get it, disaster looms.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> A dev says, "The API is throttling." You translate: "The system is overloaded,we need more servers or better code." Crisis averted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Fake understanding. Instead, ask: "Can you explain that like I'm five?"</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="documentation">
            <h2>2. Writing Down EVERYTHING (Because Memories Lie)</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> If it's not documented, it didn't happen.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> A stakeholder claims, "You never told us about this risk!" You pull up the meeting notes where you did. Mic drop.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Writing novels. Bullet points > paragraphs.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="tech-knowledge">
            <h2>3. Knowing Just Enough Tech to Be Dangerous</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> You don't need to code, but you should know why "the database is on fire" is bad.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> A dev says, "We need to migrate to Kubernetes." You ask, "Will this take 2 days or 2 weeks?" instead of "What's a Kubernetes?"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Trying to code. Your job is to manage, not debug Python at 2 AM.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="meeting-management">
            <h2>4. Herding Cats (aka Running Meetings That Don't Suck)</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Engineers hate pointless meetings. Your job: make them worth it.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Instead of "Let's discuss the sprint," try "Here's the blocker,how do we fix it in 10 minutes?"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Letting meetings drag. Set a timer. If it's done early, end early,hero status unlocked.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="stakeholder-management">
            <h2>5. Telling Stakeholders "No" Without Getting Fired</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Everyone wants everything yesterday. You're the reality check.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> "Can we add AI to this toaster project?" You say: "Sure, if you want it delivered in 2027."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Saying "no" bluntly. Try: "Let's prioritize,what's the MVP?"</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="risk-management">
            <h2>6. Risk Management (AKA Predicting the Future)</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Projects rarely go perfectly. Spotting risks early = fewer panic attacks.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> "If we don't test this soon, we'll be debugging on launch day." Spoiler: You were right.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Ignoring small risks. They grow into dumpster fires.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="prioritization">
            <h2>7. Juggling Priorities Without Dropping Any</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Everything is "urgent." Your job: decide what actually is.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> "The CEO wants a demo, but the devs are fixing a critical bug." You delay the demo. Crisis avoided.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Saying "yes" to everything. Prioritize or perish.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="tools">
            <h2>8. Using Tools Without Getting Lost in Them</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Jira, Trello, Asana,tools help, but don't let them eat your soul.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Instead of 20 custom Jira fields, you keep it simple: "To Do, Doing, Done." Bliss.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Over-customizing. Nobody needs a 50-step workflow.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="crisis-management">
            <h2>9. Being the Calm in the Storm</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> When things go wrong (they will), panic spreads fast. You're the chill voice.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> The server crashes. You say: "We've got backups. Let's restore and diagnose." Team morale saved.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Freaking out. Breathe. Then act.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="skill-section" id="learning-failure">
            <h2>10. Learning from Failure (Because It Will Happen)</h2>
            <p><span class="key-point">Why it's important:</span> Even the best projects flop. The key? Don't repeat mistakes.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> A launch fails. You run a "post-mortem," find the root cause, and fix it next time. Growth!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="avoid">
                <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Blaming people. Focus on <em>what</em> went wrong, not <em>who</em>.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="final-section">
            <h2>Final Tip: You Don't Need to Know Everything</h2>
            <p>The best TPMs ask questions, adapt, and keep the train on the tracks (most of the time).</p>
