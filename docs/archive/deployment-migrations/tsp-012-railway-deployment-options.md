# TSP Task #012 - Railway Deployment Options
## Branch Strategy Decision Required

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Current Status**: Code pushed to `feature/gitops-docs-as-code-hybrid`
**Railway Configuration**: Connected to `main` branch
**Decision Required By**: [Travis]

---

## üéØ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Merge to Main (Fastest)
**Time to Deploy**: ~5 minutes

```bash
# Merge feature branch to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/gitops-docs-as-code-hybrid
git push origin main

# Railway will auto-deploy when main updates
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Immediate deployment
- ‚úÖ No Railway reconfiguration needed
- ‚úÖ Follows GitOps workflow

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No staging test first
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Direct to production

---

### Option 2: Reconfigure Railway to Feature Branch (Recommended)
**Time to Deploy**: ~10 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Settings ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Connected Branch
3. Change from `main` to `feature/gitops-docs-as-code-hybrid`
4. Railway will auto-deploy from feature branch

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Test deployment without affecting main
- ‚úÖ Can verify everything works
- ‚úÖ Easy rollback if issues

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to reconfigure Railway
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to switch back to main later

---

### Option 3: Railway CLI Manual Deploy (Most Control)
**Time to Deploy**: ~15 minutes

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not done)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to existing project
railway link

# Deploy from current branch
railway up

# View deployment
railway open
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Deploy from any branch
- ‚úÖ No Git merge required
- ‚úÖ Full control over deployment

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual process
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need CLI setup

---

## üîß Required Environment Variables

Regardless of deployment method, set these in Railway dashboard:

```env
# Application Settings
APP_ENV=production
APP_URL=https://railways.com  # When domain is configured
BASE_PATH=/

# PHP Configuration
PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=256M
PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=30

# Railway provides automatically
PORT=<Railway assigns>
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying via any method:

- [ ] Verify Docker container still running locally
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- [ ] Check application at http://localhost:8080

- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in repository
  ```bash
  git log -1 --name-only
  ```

- [ ] Railway environment variables configured

- [ ] Domain settings prepared (if using custom domain)

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Commands

### For Option 1 (Merge to Main):
```bash
git checkout main && git merge feature/gitops-docs-as-code-hybrid && git push
```

### For Option 2 (Switch Branch in Railway):
No commands needed - use Railway dashboard

### For Option 3 (CLI Deploy):
```bash
railway up
```

---

## üéØ [Codey] Recommendation

**Recommend Option 2**: Reconfigure Railway to deploy from feature branch first
- Test deployment without affecting main
- Verify Railway build succeeds
- Check application works on Railway infrastructure
- Then merge to main once confirmed

This gives us a staging-like test before production deployment.
