## 🚂 Railway Deployment Details

### GitHub → Railway Flow
```
main branch (4fa0e8f) → Railway webhook → Docker build → Deploy
```

### What Railway is Doing Now:
1. **Pulling Code** - Cloning repository from GitHub
2. **Reading Dockerfile** - Using our custom Dockerfile
3. **Building Image** - Creating container from PHP 8.2-Apache
4. **Running Health Checks** - Verifying container starts
5. **Deploying** - Making application accessible

### Expected Build Output:
- Docker image size: ~872MB
- Build time: 2-3 minutes
- Container startup: < 5 seconds

---

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist (Completed)

- ✅ Docker files in Git
- ✅ Local testing passed
- ✅ Security validation complete
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Team approvals received
- ✅ Branch merged to main
- ✅ Push triggered deployment

## ⚠️ Environment Variables Required

**ACTION NEEDED**: Set these in Railway dashboard NOW:

```env
APP_ENV=production
BASE_PATH=/
PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=256M
PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=30
```

Railway automatically provides:
- `PORT`
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (when configured)

## 🔍 How to Monitor Deployment

### Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check build logs
3. Monitor deployment status
4. View application logs

### Verification Steps (Once Deployed)
1. **Check Railway URL**
   ```bash
   # Railway provides a URL like:
   # https://travissutphin-production.up.railway.app
   ```

2. **Test Application Routes**
   - Homepage
   - /blog
   - /projects
   - /contact

3. **Verify Docker Health**
   - Container status should be "healthy"
   - No restart loops
