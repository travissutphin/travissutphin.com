## üìù Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Git Repository Preparation (**IMMEDIATE**)

- [ ] **Add Docker files to Git**
  ```bash
  git add Dockerfile docker-compose.yml .dockerignore railway.json
  ```

- [ ] **Commit TSP-012 documentation**
  ```bash
  git add docs/deployment/tsp-012-*.md
  git add docs/deployment/DOCKER-QUICKSTART.md
  ```

- [ ] **Update kanban board**
  ```bash
  git add docs/kanban_dev.html
  ```

- [ ] **Include new content**
  ```bash
  git add content/blog/
  git add public/assets/images/blogs/
  ```

- [ ] **Create comprehensive commit**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: implement Docker containerization for Railway deployment (TSP-012)

  - Add Docker configuration files
  - Complete Phase 2 testing documentation
  - Update kanban board with migration task
  - Include deployment guides and test results

  Co-Authored-By: Gordon <lead@team>"
  ```

### 2. Environment Configuration (**REQUIRED**)

- [ ] Create `.env.example` file with required variables:
  ```env
  APP_ENV=production
  APP_URL=https://railways.com
  PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=256M
  PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=30
  ```

- [ ] Document Railway environment variables needed:
  - `PORT` (Railway provides)
  - `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`
  - Any API keys or secrets

### 3. Railway Account Setup (**NEXT STEP**)

- [ ] Create Railway account at https://railway.app
- [ ] Install Railway CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @railway/cli
  ```

- [ ] Authenticate CLI:
  ```bash
  railway login
  ```

- [ ] Create new project:
  ```bash
  railway init
  ```

### 4. Branch Strategy (**RECOMMENDED**)

- [ ] Create deployment branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/railway-deployment
  ```

- [ ] Push to remote:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin feature/railway-deployment
  ```

- [ ] Create PR for review

### 5. Security Verification (**MANDATORY**)

- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` includes:
  - `.env`
  - `*.log`
  - `.DS_Store`
  - `node_modules/`

- [ ] Check no secrets in committed files
- [ ] Review Dockerfile for security best practices
- [ ] Confirm production settings

### 6. Testing Requirements (**BEFORE DEPLOY**)

- [ ] Local Docker tests pass ‚úÖ
- [ ] PHP syntax validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] Security checks complete ‚úÖ
- [ ] Railway staging deployment
- [ ] Staging smoke tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### 7. Documentation Updates (**CURRENT**)

- [ ] README.md with Railway badge
- [ ] Deployment instructions
- [ ] Environment variable docs
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### 8. Team Sign-offs (**FINAL**)

| Role | Team Member | Sign-off | Date |
|------|-------------|----------|------|
| DevOps Lead | [Flow] | Pending | - |
| Security | [Sentinel] | Pending | - |
| Principal Eng | [Syntax] | Pending | - |
| QA Lead | [Verity] | Pending | - |
| TPM | [Codey] | Pending | - |
| Product Owner | [Travis] | Required | - |

## üöÄ Deployment Sequence (After Checklist)

1. **Staging Deployment**
   ```bash
   railway up --environment staging
   ```

2. **Verify Staging**
   - Test all routes
   - Check performance
   - Validate SSL

3. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   railway up --environment production
   ```

4. **DNS Configuration**
   - Point railways.com to Railway
   - Verify SSL certificate
   - Test domain resolution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Blockers

### **BLOCKER 1: Git Repository Not Ready**
- **Impact**: Railway cannot deploy
- **Resolution**: Commit all Docker files immediately
- **Owner**: [Flow] / [Travis]

### **BLOCKER 2: Railway Account Not Created**
- **Impact**: Cannot proceed with deployment
- **Resolution**: Create account and configure project
- **Owner**: [Travis] (Product Owner approval needed)

### **BLOCKER 3: Environment Variables Not Documented**
- **Impact**: Deployment may fail
- **Resolution**: Create .env.example and document
- **Owner**: [Syntax]

## üìä Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Uncommitted files lost | Medium | High | Commit immediately |
| Railway config issues | Low | Medium | Test in staging first |
| DNS propagation delay | Medium | Low | Keep local running |
| SSL cert problems | Low | High | Railway handles automatically |

## üí¨ [Codey] Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:

1. **[Travis]** - We need your approval to:
   - Commit all Docker files to Git
   - Create Railway account
   - Proceed with staging deployment

2. **[Flow]** - Please:
   - Stage and commit Docker files
   - Verify branch strategy
   - Prepare for Railway CLI setup

3. **[Team]** - Stand by for:
   - Code review once committed
   - Staging deployment testing
   - Production go-live decision

**Timeline Impact**: Each day of delay pushes our 14-day migration timeline. We're currently on Day 1 of Phase 2 (complete), ready for Phase 3.
