### Content Planning (MarketingTeam)
1. Open `kanban_content.html`
2. Review content calendar
3. Update progress on blog posts
4. Plan next week's content

### Sprint Planning

## Archiving and Cleanup

### When to Archive Cards
- **Dev board:** After sprint review (every 2 weeks)

### How to Archive
1. Review "Done" column
2. Screenshot or export task details if needed for reference

4. Keep board clean and focused on active work

**Note:** Session summaries in `/docs/sessions/` serve as historical record of completed work

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Board won't open or shows errors
**A:** Ensure you're opening the `.html` file in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Q: Changes aren't saving
**A:** Most kanban boards auto-save to browser localStorage. Clearing browser cache will reset the board. Export important data regularly.

### Q: I don't know which board to use
**A:**
- Technical task? ‚Üí `kanban_dev.html`
- Content/blog task? ‚Üí `kanban_content.html`
- Other/admin task? ‚Üí `kanban.html`
- Still unsure? Ask [Codey]

### Q: Who updates the boards?
**A:**
- **Assignees** update their own cards daily
- **[Codey]** maintains overall structure and facilitates updates
- **[Travis]** (Product Owner) adds new tasks to backlog

## Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Update your cards daily
- Use clear, action-oriented task names

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Let cards go stale (no updates for 1+ week)

- Skip moving cards to "Done" when complete
- Ignore blockers or dependencies
