## 🎯 How to Start (3 Steps)

### **STEP 1: Read the Quick Start Guide** (15 minutes)
Location: `/docs/design/QUICK-START-AUDIT.md`

This gives you:
- Overview of what to audit
- 3 high-priority checks to do first
- Day-by-day breakdown
- Tips for efficiency

### **STEP 2: Do the 3 High-Priority Checks** (30 minutes)
These have immediate business impact:

**Priority #1: Mobile Image Performance** ⚠️
- Go to `/blog` page
- Open DevTools → Network tab → Filter: Images
- Check blog post image sizes
- **Expected Issue**: Images 250KB+ (should be <100KB)
- **Impact**: HIGH (affects SEO Core Web Vitals)

**Priority #2: Call-to-Action Clarity** ⚠️
- Visit each page: Home, Services, Projects, Team, Blog, Contact
- Ask: "Within 3 seconds, what's the MAIN action I should take?"
- **Expected Issue**: Unclear primary CTAs
- **Impact**: HIGH (affects conversion rate)

**Priority #3: Mobile Touch Targets** ⚠️
- Open DevTools → Device mode: iPhone SE (375x667)
- Test Contact form, Blog cards, Bottom navigation
- **Expected Issue**: Some buttons <44px (too small to tap)
- **Impact**: HIGH (affects mobile usability)

### **STEP 3: Full Audit Using Checklist** (4-6 hours)
Location: `/docs/design/visual-brand-audit-checklist.md`

Work through sections in order:
1. Color Consistency (Section 1)
2. Typography (Section 2)
3. Spacing & Layout (Section 3)
4. Component Consistency (Section 4)
5. Mobile UX (Section 6)
6. Dark/Light Mode (Section 7)

## 📸 How to Document Findings

### **Take Screenshots**
Save to: `/docs/design/audit-screenshots/[page-name]/`

**Naming Convention:**
- `issue-[description].png` - For inconsistencies
- `good-[description].png` - For patterns to replicate
- Include mode: `home-dark-mode-contrast-issue.png`

**Screenshot Folders Already Created:**
- `/audit-screenshots/home/`
- `/audit-screenshots/services/`

### **Document in Report Template**
Use template from Section 10 of main checklist:

```markdown
| Priority | Issue | Pages Affected | Impact | Effort |

| 🔴 HIGH | Blog images not optimized | Blog List | SEO/Performance | 2h |
| 🔴 HIGH | No clear primary CTA | Home | Conversion | 3h |
```

## 🎨 What You're Looking For

### **Inconsistencies to Flag:**

**Colors:**
- Are all CTAs using the same gradient?
- Do link colors match across pages?
- Is dark mode intentional or retrofitted?

**Typography:**
- Are H2 headings always the same size?
- Is body text always 16px?
- Do font weights vary (bold, semibold)?

**Spacing:**
- Section padding: py-16 everywhere or varies?
- Card padding: Always p-6 or mixed?
- Grid gaps: Consistent across all grids?

**Components:**
- Button styles: Consistent or different per page?
- Card styles: Same shadows? Same border-radius?
- Form inputs: Consistent styling?

### **Design Patterns to Document:**

**Keep These (Intentional Design):**
- Featured blog card uses larger shadow → Intentional hierarchy ✅
- Hero sections have more padding → Intentional emphasis ✅

**Document the Standards:**
```
Colors:
- Primary CTA: gradient-green-blue
- Card backgrounds: bg-white (light) / [what in dark?]

Typography:
- H1: text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold
- H2: text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold
- Body: text-base (16px)

Spacing:
- Section vertical: py-16
- Card padding: p-6 or p-8
- Grid gap: gap-8
```
