# 10 Technical PM Skills Nobody Warned You About

Being a Technical Project Manager isn't about memorizing every JavaScript framework or knowing how to deploy Kubernetes clusters. It's about being the translator, the roadblock-clearer, and sometimes the person who says "no" to impossible timelines.

Here are the **10 essential skills** that actually matter in the trenches:

## 1. Speaking "Engineer" Without Sounding Like a Robot

**Why it's important:** Engineers have their own language (e.g., "Just refactor the tech debt!"). If you nod along pretending you get it, disaster looms.

**Real-world example:** A dev says, "The API is throttling." You translate: "The system is overloaded, we need more servers or better code." Crisis averted.

**Avoid:** Fake understanding. Instead, ask: "Can you explain that like I'm five?"

## 2. Writing Down EVERYTHING (Because Memories Lie)

**Why it's important:** If it's not documented, it didn't happen.

**Real-world example:** A stakeholder claims, "You never told us about this risk!" You pull up the meeting notes where you did. Mic drop.

**Avoid:** Writing novels. Bullet points > paragraphs.

## 3. Knowing Just Enough Tech to Be Dangerous

**Why it's important:** You don't need to code, but you should know why "the database is on fire" is bad.

**Real-world example:** A dev says, "We need to migrate to Kubernetes." You ask, "Will this take 2 days or 2 weeks?" instead of "What's a Kubernetes?"

**Avoid:** Trying to code. Your job is to manage, not debug Python at 2 AM.

## 4. Herding Cats (aka Running Meetings That Don't Suck)

**Why it's important:** Engineers hate pointless meetings. Your job: make them worth it.

**Real-world example:** Instead of "Let's discuss the sprint," try "Here's the blocker, how do we fix it in 10 minutes?"

**Avoid:** Letting meetings drag. Set a timer. If it's done early, end early—hero status unlocked.

## 5. Telling Stakeholders "No" Without Getting Fired

**Why it's important:** Everyone wants everything yesterday. You're the reality check.

**Real-world example:** "Can we add AI to this toaster project?" You say: "Sure, if you want it delivered in 2027."

**Avoid:** Saying "no" bluntly. Try: "Let's prioritize, what's the MVP?"

## 6. Risk Management (AKA Predicting the Future)

**Why it's important:** Projects rarely go perfectly. Spotting risks early = fewer panic attacks.

**Real-world example:** "If we don't test this soon, we'll be debugging on launch day." Spoiler: You were right.

**Avoid:** Ignoring small risks. They grow into dumpster fires.

## 7. Juggling Priorities Without Dropping Any

**Why it's important:** Everything is "urgent." Your job: decide what actually is.

**Real-world example:** "The CEO wants a demo, but the devs are fixing a critical bug." You delay the demo. Crisis avoided.

**Avoid:** Saying "yes" to everything. Prioritize or perish.

## 8. Using Tools Without Getting Lost in Them

**Why it's important:** Jira, Trello, Asana—tools help, but don't let them eat your soul.

**Real-world example:** Instead of 20 custom Jira fields, you keep it simple: "To Do, Doing, Done." Bliss.

**Avoid:** Over-customizing. Nobody needs a 50-step workflow.

## 9. Being the Calm in the Storm

**Why it's important:** When things go wrong (they will), panic spreads fast. You're the chill voice.

**Real-world example:** The server crashes. You say: "We've got backups. Let's restore and diagnose." Team morale saved.

**Avoid:** Freaking out. Breathe. Then act.

## 10. Learning from Failure (Because It Will Happen)

**Why it's important:** Even the best projects flop. The key? Don't repeat mistakes.

**Real-world example:** A launch fails. You run a "post-mortem," find the root cause, and fix it next time. Growth!

**Avoid:** Blaming people. Focus on *what* went wrong, not *who*.

## Final Tip: You Don't Need to Know Everything

The best TPMs ask questions, adapt, and keep the train on the tracks (most of the time).

**Now go forth and manage—just don't forget the coffee.**
