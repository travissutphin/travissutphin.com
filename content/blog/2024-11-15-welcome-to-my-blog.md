# Welcome to My Technical Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog where I'll be sharing my experiences helping founders finish their apps and integrate AI into their workflows.

## What You'll Find Here

Over the coming weeks and months, I'll be covering topics including:

- **Finishing Stalled Projects**: Practical strategies for getting your app across the finish line
- **AI Integration**: Real-world examples of adding AI capabilities to existing applications
- **Technical Leadership**: Insights from my work as a fractional CTO
- **Automation**: How to save hours with smart workflow automation

## Why This Matters

Every day I talk to founders who have an app that's 80% complete but can't seem to finish that last 20%. It's more common than you think, and there are proven strategies to break through.

## What's Next

I'll be posting weekly with practical, actionable content. No fluff, just real solutions to real problems.

Stay tuned for my next post where I'll dive into the most common reasons projects stall and how to overcome them.
