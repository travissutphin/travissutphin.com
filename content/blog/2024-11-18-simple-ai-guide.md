# Add AI to Your App This Week

Adding AI to your app is easier than ever. This guide shows you how.

## Why Add AI Now

AI can help your app in three main ways:

1. Automate repetitive tasks
2. Improve user experience
3. Increase engagement

## Choose Your Provider

For most apps, I recommend OpenAI because:

- Best documentation
- Stable API
- Good pricing

## Quick Start

First, get your API key from OpenAI. Then install the package:

```
npm install openai
```

Create a simple service:

```
const OpenAI = require('openai');
const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'your-key' });
```

## Your First Feature

Start with something simple like text improvement:

```
async function improveText(text) {
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [{role: 'user', content: text}]
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

## Cost Management

Most apps spend less than $100 per month on AI. Tips to save:

- Cache responses
- Use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4
- Limit request length

## Security Tips

Never put API keys in frontend code. Always call AI from your backend.
