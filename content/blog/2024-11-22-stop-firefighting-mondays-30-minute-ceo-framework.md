# Stop Firefighting Mondays: The 30-Minute CEO Framework That Transforms Your Week

Why do Mondays feel like putting out fires while juggling chainsaws? Because we're doing it wrong.

I used to start each week reacting to whatever landed in my inbox. The result? Constant stress, missed deadlines, and that nagging feeling that I was always playing catch-up.

## Here's what changed everything:

I now spend 30 minutes every Monday morning in "CEO mode" - treating my week like a business that needs strategic direction. The transformation has been incredible:

## Before:
- Racing to respond to every "urgent" email
- Back-to-back meetings with no prep time
- Important projects pushed aside for daily firefighting
- Weekend work just to stay afloat

## After:
- Time blocked for deep work when my energy peaks
- Meetings clustered for maximum efficiency
- Clear priorities that actually drive results
- Evenings and weekends back with family

## The simple framework I use:

1. **Brain dump everything on your plate** (15 mins)
2. **Identify your top 3 needle-moving priorities** (5 mins)
3. **Block time for these BEFORE your calendar fills up** (10 mins)

The best part? That constant anxiety of "dropping the ball" vanishes when you know exactly where your focus needs to be.

Start with just 30 minutes this Monday. You'll be amazed how much clarity changes everything.
