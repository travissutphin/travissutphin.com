Why do Mondays feel like putting out fires while juggling chainsaws? Because we're doing it wrong.

I used to start each week reacting to whatever landed in my inbox. The result? Constant stress, missed deadlines, and that nagging feeling that I was always playing catch-up.

## Here's what changed everything:

I now spend 30 minutes every Monday morning in "CEO mode" - treating my week like a business that needs strategic direction. The transformation has been incredible:

## Before:
- Racing to respond to every "urgent" email
- Back-to-back meetings with no prep time
- Important projects pushed aside for daily firefighting
- Weekend work just to stay afloat

## After:
- Time blocked for deep work when my energy peaks
- Meetings clustered for maximum efficiency
- Clear priorities that actually drive results
- Evenings and weekends back with family

## The simple framework I use:

1. **Brain dump everything on your plate** (15 mins)
2. **Identify your top 3 needle-moving priorities** (5 mins)
3. **Block time for these BEFORE your calendar fills up** (10 mins)

The best part? That constant anxiety of "dropping the ball" vanishes when you know exactly where your focus needs to be.
