# Why Every Project Manager Needs a Weekly Big 3

As a Senior Project Manager, I've run projects with dozens of team members, shifting priorities, surprise roadblocks, and stakeholders who change their minds faster than the weather. But through it all, one habit has consistently helped me—and my teams—stay focused and drive results: the weekly **Big 3**.

These aren't just to-do list items. They're *mission-critical* outcomes that shape the week. Here's why the Big 3 matters and why it should be part of your project-management toolkit.

## 1. Clarity Over Chaos

In fast-moving environments, it's easy to mistake movement for progress. Without clear weekly priorities, you risk spending hours in meetings, responding to endless Slack messages, and checking off low-impact tasks only to realize you didn't actually *move the needle*.

The Big 3 forces you to pause and ask:

> "What three outcomes would make this week a win?"

That shift in mindset helps cut through the noise and identify what truly matters.

## 2. Team Alignment & Accountability

When everyone on the team knows your top three priorities, two things happen:

1. They **align their efforts** to support you.
2. They **hold you accountable** to what you committed.

Whether you're managing stakeholders, QA, or a sprint backlog, transparency around your weekly Big 3 encourages proactive updates, faster decisions, and better teamwork.

**Bonus:** It's a great way to model accountability for junior PMs or cross-functional partners.

## 3. Momentum You Can Measure

Projects don't stall because of one big failure. They stall from weeks of busywork with no forward motion.

When you hit your Big 3 week after week, it builds a *compound effect*. Progress becomes visible. Wins stack up. And stakeholders stay confident because they can see real outcomes, even if the full deliverable is still weeks away.

## What Makes a Great Big 3?

- **Contributes directly** to the project's success or removes a blocker
- **Is achievable** within the week
- **Is specific and outcome-driven** (e.g., "Finalize client sign-off on UI wireframes," not "Work on wireframes")

## Example Big 3 for a Stuck AI Project:

1. **Complete API error handling for production deployment**
2. **Get stakeholder approval on final user interface design**
3. **Finalize hosting configuration and launch checklist**

Each item moves the project closer to completion, not just closer to "more work."

## Final Thought: Don't Let the Week Run You

As project managers, we often serve everyone else's priorities, supporting the team, managing risk, solving problems. But if we don't carve out space to prioritize what matters most, we become reactive.

A Big 3 list is a simple but powerful guardrail to stay proactive, stay focused, and ensure you're leading, not just managing the project.

**Try it this week.** Write down your Big 3. Share it with your team. And then deliver.
