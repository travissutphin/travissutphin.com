# The 5 Reasons Your Project Stalled (And How to Fix Them)

After helping dozens of founders complete their stalled projects, I've identified five common patterns. If your project is stuck, it's likely due to one of these issues.

## 1. Scope Creep

**The Problem**: What started as a simple MVP has grown into a complex beast with features you don't actually need for launch.

**The Fix**: Strip back to essentials. List every feature and ask "Can we launch without this?" If yes, move it to v2.

## 2. Technical Debt

**The Problem**: Quick fixes and workarounds have accumulated, making new features increasingly difficult to add.

**The Fix**: Stop adding features. Spend a sprint just refactoring and cleaning up code. It'll pay dividends.

## 3. Lost Momentum

**The Problem**: The initial excitement has worn off, and progress has slowed to a crawl.

**The Fix**: Set smaller, achievable milestones. Nothing builds momentum like regular wins.

## 4. Perfectionism

**The Problem**: You're endlessly tweaking instead of shipping.

**The Fix**: Remember that done is better than perfect. You can always iterate after launch.

## 5. Resource Constraints

**The Problem**: Your developer left, or you've run out of budget for the current approach.

**The Fix**: Consider bringing in specialized help to get across the finish line. Often, an experienced developer can complete in weeks what might take months otherwise.

## The Path Forward

If you recognize your project in any of these scenarios, don't despair. Every stalled project can be completed with the right approach and mindset.

The key is to be honest about what's blocking you and take decisive action to address it.
